# Case Study in Human Resources: Understanding Absenteeism Patterns and Enhancing Performance

## Context
The manager of a medium-sized company has observed a decline in team performance, prompting them to investigate the root cause, which has been identified as absenteeism. To address this issue, additional research is required to determine the necessary preventive measures.

## Overview

Given access to a Human Resources Absenteeism dataset, the task is to utilize this dataset to construct a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will serve as a tool to extract insights and respond to inquiries related to employee absenteeism.
